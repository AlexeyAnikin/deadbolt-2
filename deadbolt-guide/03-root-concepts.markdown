# Root concepts #

D2 is centered around a single idea - restricting access to a resource to a specific group of users.  I've had several e-mails from developers who have thought that Deadbolt had a "restrict from" approach, and therefore could not understand why the authorisation was failing so spectacularly; to forestall future questions about this, I want to make it completely clear - D2 uses "restrict to".  For example, a controller action annotated with `@Restrict("foo")` would only allow users with the "foo" role to access the method.

Two mechanisms are provided to declare these restrictions - one at the template level and another at the controller level.  In each case, there are differences between how these are applied in Java and Scala applications, so specific details will be provided in later chapters.

## Template-level restrictions ##
For a Play 2 application that uses server-side rendering, D2 provides several template tags that will conceal or reveal DOM elements based on your specifications.

A couple of basic use cases are
* Only displayed a "Log in" link if there is no user present
* Even if a user is logged in, only display an "Administration" link if the user has administrative privileges

However, it is **extremely** important to note that using these tags will only give you a cleaner UI, one that is better tailored to the user's privileges.  It will **not** secure your server-side code in any way except - possibly - obscurity.  Server-side routes can be invoked from outside of templates by changing the URL in the browser's address bar, using command-line tools such as cURL and many other ways.

If you have seen the original Dawn Of The Dead (Romero, 1978), you may remember the protagonists concealing the entrance to their living quarters using a panel of painted hardboard.  There are no additional defensive layers behind this concealment.  When a zombified protagonist breaks through the hardboard, knowing there is something he wants on the other side, all security is gone.  Minutes later, there's blood everywhere and the survivors have to flee.

Template security is like painted hardboard - the features it offers are certainly nice to have, but a further level of defensive depth is required.  For this, you need controller action security - otherwise, the zombies will get you.
