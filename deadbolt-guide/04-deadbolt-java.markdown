# Using Deadbolt 2 with Play 2 Java projects #

Deadbolt 2 for Java provides an idiomatic API for dealing with Java controllers and templates rendered from Java controllers in Play 2 applications.

## Deferring method-level annotation-driven actions ##
Play 2 executes method-level annotations before controller-level annotations. This can cause issues when, for example, you want a particular action to be applied for method and before the method annotations. A good example is `Security.Authenticated(Secured.class)`, which sets a userâ€™s user name for `request().username()`. Combining this with method-level annotations that require a user would fail, because the user would not be present at the time the method interceptor is invoked.

One way around this is to apply `Security.Authenticated` on every method, which violates DRY and causes bloat.

    public class DeferredController extends Controller {

        @Security.Authenticated(Secured.class)
        @Restrict(value="admin")
        public static Result someAdminFunction() {
            return ok(accessOk.render());
        }

        @Security.Authenticated(Secured.class)
        @Restrict(value="editor")
        public static Result someEditorFunction() {
            return ok(accessOk.render());
        }
    }

A better way is to set the `deferred` parameter of the D2 annotation to `true`, and then use `@DeferredDeadbolt` at the controller level to execute the method-level annotations at controller-annotation time. Since annotations are processed in order of declaration, you can specify `@DeferredDeadbolt` after `@Security.Authenticated` and so achieve the desired effect.

    @Security.Authenticated(Secured.class)
    @DeferredDeadbolt
    public class DeferredController extends Controller {

        @Restrict(value="admin", deferred=true)
        public static Result someAdminFunction() {
            return ok(accessOk.render());
        }

        @Restrict(value="admin", deferred=true)
        public static Result someAdminFunction() {
            return ok(accessOk.render());
        }
    }
